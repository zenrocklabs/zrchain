ZENROCK FOUNDATION (“FOUNDATION”) PROVIDES TO YOU CERTAIN RIGHTS TO USE THE ZENROCK PROTOCOL SOFTWARE AT HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/ZENROCKLABS/ and HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/ZENROCK-FOUNDATION/ (the “LICENSED SOFTWARE”) UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE (“LICENSE”). THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

This License will commence on the date of your acceptance of the License in connection with the use of the Licensed Software and will continue in full force and effect until the Change Date, unless earlier terminated by Foundation.

8. General. You may not assign or transfer this License, by operation of law or otherwise, without Foundation’s prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this License is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. If any provision of this License is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, given the fundamental intentions of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this License will remain in full force and effect. This License is the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to its subject matter. This License may be amended or modified only by a written document executed by duly authorized representatives of the parties. Nothing in this License will be construed to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other’s behalf without such other party’s prior written consent. Except as expressly set forth in this License, the exercise by either party of any remedy under this License will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this License or otherwise. Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. No waiver of any provision of this License will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver. This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Cayman Islands without giving effect to any principles of conflict of laws that would lead to the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to or application of conflicts of law rules or principles. Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to this License, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration to be by the Cayman International Mediation & Arbitration Centre (CI-MAC) and governed by the Arbitration Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and the place of arbitration shall be in the Cayman Islands. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The decision of the sole arbitrator to any such dispute, controversy, difference or claim shall be final and binding upon both parties. If any litigation or arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of this License, the prevailing party will be entitled to have their attorney fees paid by the other party. Each party waives any right it may have to assert the doctrine of forum non convenience, to assert that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such arbitration or courts or to object to venue to the extent any proceeding is brought in accordance herewith.
