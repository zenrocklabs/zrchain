## Concepts

### Keyrings

Keyrings represent off-chain systems that provide keys and signatures. One example of this is the Zenrock MPC system.

Keyrings have a distinct address. This is used to select the keyring when performing key and signature requests.

Keyrings also define how many parties are involved. Only parties inside the keyring object are eligible to broadcast responses on-chain.

Lastly, a keyring provider can set the costs that occur for each key and signature request.

### Workspaces

Workspaces allow users (Workspace owners) to manage sets of keys. This allows key rotation and decouples the risk from managing wallets through one single account.

Apart from having associated keys, workspace settings also define policies for admin and signature tasks.

Policies define governance of the Workspace. They typically specify which combination of accounts must provide approval for a signature to be considered valid.

Policies also provide a governance structure for Workspace changes and can be used to prevent giving a single account full control over the Workspace.

...

## State

The `identity` module uses the `collections` package which provides collection storage.

Here's the list of collections stored as part of the `identity` module.

### Keyring store

The `KeyringStore` stores `Keyring`: `String(KeyringAddress) -> ProtocolBuffer(Keyring)`.

### Workspace store

The `WorkspaceStore` stores `Workspace`: `String(WorkspaceAddress) -> ProtocolBuffer(Workspace)`.

## Msg Service

### Msg/NewWorkspace

A new workspace can be created with the `MsgNewWorkspace`, which can specify the admin policy, sign policy and an optional list of additional owners to be added, additional to the creator of the tx.
By default you can specify 0 for admin or sign policy id in which case the creator will be the only member of a default policy.

```proto
message MsgNewWorkspace {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  uint64 admin_policy_id = 2;
  uint64 sign_policy_id = 3;
  repeated string additional_owners = 4; // Optional
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the creator or additional owners are not members of the specified admin or sign policy

### Msg/AddWorkspaceOwner

An additional member can be added with the `MsgAddWorkspaceOwner` message.

```go reference
message MsgAddWorkspaceOwner {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string workspace_addr = 2;
  string new_owner = 3;
  uint64 btl = 4;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the workspace is not found
* the transaction creator is not an owner of the workspace
* the new owner is already an owner of the workspace

This action creates a policy action that requires approval based on the workspace's admin policy. When approved, the owner is added to the workspace.

### Msg/RemoveWorkspaceOwner

An existing owner can be removed from a workspace with the `MsgRemoveWorkspaceOwner` message.

```proto
message MsgRemoveWorkspaceOwner {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string workspace_addr = 2;
  string owner = 3;
  uint64 btl = 4;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the workspace is not found
* the transaction creator is not an owner of the workspace
* the existing owner is not an owner of the workspace
* the existing owner is a member of the assigned admin or sign policy

This action creates a policy action that requires approval based on the workspace's admin policy.

### Msg/NewChildWorkspace

A new child workspace can be created with the `MsgNewChildWorkspace` message.

```proto
message MsgNewChildWorkspace {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string parent_workspace_addr = 2;
  uint64 btl = 3;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the parent workspace is not found
* the transaction creator is not an owner of the workspace

This action creates a policy action that requires approval based on the parent workspace's admin policy.

### Msg/AppendChildWorkspace

An existing workspace can be added to another existing workspace as a child workspace with the `MsgAppendChildWorkspace` message.

```proto
message MsgAppendChildWorkspace {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string parent_workspace_addr = 2;
  string child_workspace_addr = 3;
  uint64 btl = 4;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the parent or child workspace is not found
* the transaction creator is not an owner of the parent or child workspace
* the child workspace is already a child of the parent workspace

This action creates a policy action that requires approval based on the parent workspace's admin policy.

### Msg/UpdateWorkspace

An existing workspace can be update with the `MsgUpdateWorkspace` message.

```proto
message MsgUpdateWorkspace {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string workspace_addr = 2;
  uint64 admin_policy_id = 3;
  uint64 sign_policy_id = 4;
  uint64 btl = 5;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the workspace is not found
* the transaction creator is not an owner of the workspace
* there are no updates to the policies
* the owners are not members of the specified new admin or sign policy
* the specified policy IDs don't exist

This action creates a policy action that requires approval based on the workspace's current admin policy.

### Msg/NewKeyring

A new keyring can be created with the `MsgNewKeyring` message.

```proto
message MsgNewKeyring {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string description = 2;
  uint32 party_threshold = 3;
  uint64 key_req_fee = 4;
  uint64 sig_req_fee = 5;
  bool delegate_fees = 6;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the balance of the transaction sender is too low to pay the KeyringCreationFee parameter

The creator is automatically added as an admin of the keyring, and the keyring is set to active by default.

### Msg/AddKeyringParty

A new party can be added to an existing keyring with the `MsgAddKeyringParty` message.

```proto
message MsgAddKeyringParty {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string keyring_addr = 2;
  string party = 3;
  bool increase_threshold = 4; // Optional flag
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the keyring is not found
* the keyring is not active
* the party is already added to the keyring
* the transaction creator is not an admin of the keyring

When adding a party, the threshold is set to at least 1 if it was previously 0.

### Msg/AddKeyringAdmin

A new admin can be added to an existing keyring with the `MsgAddKeyringAdmin` message.

```proto
message MsgAddKeyringAdmin {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string keyring_addr = 2;
  string admin = 3;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the keyring is not found
* the keyring is not active
* the admin is already an admin of the keyring
* the transaction creator is not an admin of the keyring

### Msg/RemoveKeyringParty

An party can be removed from a keyring with the `MsgRemoveKeyringParty` message.

```proto
message MsgRemoveKeyringParty {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string keyring_addr = 2;
  string party = 3;
  bool decrease_threshold = 4; // Optional flag
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the keyring is not found
* the keyring is not active
* the party is not a party of the keyring
* the transaction creator is not an admin of the keyring

### Msg/RemoveKeyringAdmin

An admin can be removed from a keyring with the `MsgRemoveKeyringAdmin` message.

```proto
message MsgRemoveKeyringAdmin {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string keyring_addr = 2;
  string admin = 3;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the keyring is not found
* the keyring is not active
* the admin is not an admin of the keyring
* the transaction creator is not an admin of the keyring
* the admin to remove is the last admin in the keyring

### Msg/DeactivateKeyring

A keyring can be deactivated using the `MsgDeactivateKeyring` message.

```proto
message MsgDeactivateKeyring {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string keyring_addr = 2;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* the keyring is not found
* the transaction creator is not a keyring admin

Deactivating a keyring sets its `is_active` status to false, which prevents it from creating new keys or signing new requests.

### Msg/UpdateKeyring

A keyring can be updated with the `MsgUpdateKeyring` message.

```proto
message MsgUpdateKeyring {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";
  string creator = 1;
  string keyring_addr = 2;
  uint32 party_threshold = 3;
  uint64 key_req_fee = 4;
  uint64 sig_req_fee = 5;
  string description = 6;
  bool is_active = 7;
}
```

It's expected to fail if:

* keyring is not found
* the transaction creator is not a keyring admin

This message allows updating multiple keyring attributes in a single transaction including the threshold, fees, description, and active status.
