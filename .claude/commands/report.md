   Example format:

   - Added `Asset.ASSET_ZENZEC` to `proto/zrchain/dct/params.proto`

   - [Changes to vote extensions or consensus logic]
   - [Impact on validator behavior]

   Example format:

   - Modified `PreBlocker` to handle ZCash header consensus
   - Added `storeZcashBlockHeaders()` function in validation keeper
   - Validators must upgrade sidecar to support ZCash RPC

   ### Dependencies Added

   - [Dependency name] - [Version] - [Reason for addition]

     - Migration: API consumers must regenerate proto bindings and update message construction
   - **State Breaking**: Modified `PendingMintTransaction` schema to include `asset_type` field
     - Migration: Requires chain upgrade with state migration handler

   ## Security & Decentralization

   _(Skip this section if there are no security implications or decentralization considerations)_

   ### Security Implications

   - [Security consideration or audit point]
   - [Potential risk and mitigation]

   Example format:

   - **Oracle Consensus**: ZCash header verification relies on 2/3+ validator consensus via vote extensions
     - Risk: Malicious validators could submit incorrect headers
     - Mitigation: Requires supermajority agreement; validators stake is at risk
   - **Merkle Proof Verification**: Deposit verification uses cryptographic proof against stored headers
     - Risk: Header storage must be tamper-proof
     - Mitigation: Headers stored in consensus state, protected by blockchain immutability
   - **MPC Signing**: Redemption transactions require threshold signatures from treasury module
     - Risk: Single key compromise could enable unauthorized withdrawals
     - Mitigation: Multi-party computation with threshold requirements (t-of-n)

   ### Decentralization Posture

   - [How changes affect decentralization]
   - [Alignment with security & decentralization principles]

   Example format:

   - **Oracle Data**: Block headers fetched from decentralized validator set, not single source
   - **Consensus Driven**: All critical operations (mints, burns, redemptions) require validator consensus
   - **No Trusted Bridge**: Cryptographic proofs used instead of trusted third parties
   - **Validator Requirements**: Changes may require validators to run additional RPC nodes (e.g., ZCash)
     - Impact: Increases validator operational complexity but maintains security properties

   ## Deployment Considerations

   _(Skip this section if no deployment considerations apply)_

   ### Deployment Steps

   - [Step 1]
   - [Step 2]

   Example format:

   1. **Pre-upgrade**: Announce upgrade height and coordinate with validators
   2. **Sidecar Update**: Validators upgrade sidecar binaries to support new RPC clients
   3. **Chain Upgrade**: Execute governance proposal for chain upgrade at target height
   4. **State Migration**: Run state migration handler (if applicable)
   5. **Post-upgrade**: Verify new functionality operational across validator set
   6. **Parameter Update**: Submit governance proposal to activate new asset parameters

   ### Rollback Plan

   [Description of how to rollback if needed]

   Example format:

   - If upgrade fails at target height, validators can restart with previous binary
   - State migration is forward-only; rollback requires chain halt and restoration from snapshot
   - For non-consensus changes (e.g., sidecar updates), validators can independently rollback

   ### Testing in Production

   [Any monitoring or gradual rollout strategy]

   Example format:

   - Monitor block production for 100 blocks post-upgrade
   - Test deposit verification with small amounts first (testnet → mainnet progression)
   - Gradual rollout: Enable new asset type in testnet for 1 week before mainnet
   - Alert validators to monitor for unusual vote extension behavior
   - Track oracle consensus metrics (header agreement percentage)

3. **Save the Report**
   - Save the report to `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-[report-name].md`
   - Use the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Use the report name provided by the user (converted to kebab-case)

4. **Report Content Guidelines**
   - Be comprehensive but concise
   - Use bullet points for easy scanning
   - Include specific examples and code snippets where relevant
   - When referencing files, use markdown links: `[filename](path/to/file.md)`
   - Highlight important insights or lessons learned
   - Include metrics if applicable (number of files changed, features added, bugs fixed, etc.)
   - **Purpose for sharing**: Reports are checked into the repository and shared with team members for context
   - **Purpose for future reference**: Reports are searchable and can be referenced when similar problems arise
   - **Searchable content**: Include enough detail that the report can be discovered via keyword search
   - **Security & decentralization focus**: Emphasize security implications, decentralization considerations, and alignment with project principles
   - **zrChain-specific considerations**:
     - Note any changes to consensus logic (ABCI, vote extensions, PreBlocker)
     - Document module interdependencies (e.g., validation ↔ dct ↔ zenbtc)
     - Highlight zenBTC regression testing (DO NOT break production zenBTC)
     - Note protocol buffer changes and API compatibility
     - Document validator requirements (sidecar changes, RPC endpoints, etc.)
     - Include state migration requirements if applicable
     - Note governance proposals needed for parameter changes

5. **Ask Follow-Up Questions AFTER Generating Report**
   - After the report is generated and saved, ask 5-7 thoughtful follow-up questions
   - These questions should NOT be included in the report itself
   - Questions should help capture missing information
   - Ask about user satisfaction and outcomes
   - Inquire about areas needing more detail
   - Ask about priorities for future work
   - Keep questions open-ended to encourage detailed responses

6. **Use User Answers to Improve Report**
   - After receiving the follow-up questions, review the report and identify any gaps
   - If a question revealed missing information, add it to the report
   - If a question revealed a new insight, incorporate it into the report
   - If a question revealed a need for clarification, update the report
   - If a question revealed a potential improvement, note it for future work
